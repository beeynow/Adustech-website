# ADUSTECH Website Countdown Configuration
# ==========================================

# Countdown duration in MINUTES
# This makes it easy to test and configure
# Examples:
#   COUNTDOWN_MINUTES=10    → 10 minutes countdown
#   COUNTDOWN_MINUTES=10    → 1 hour countdown
#   COUNTDOWN_MINUTES=100   → 10 hours countdown
#   COUNTDOWN_MINUTES=1440  → 24 hours (1 day) countdown
# 
# Set to 0 to disable countdown and make website immediately accessible
COUNTDOWN_MINUTES=30

# Enable or disable countdown mode
# Set to false to make website immediately accessible regardless of time
COUNTDOWN_ENABLED=true

# Advanced: You can also set a specific launch date instead
# Format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (UTC)
# Example: LAUNCH_DATE=2026-02-06T12:00:00Z
# Leave empty to use COUNTDOWN_MINUTES
LAUNCH_DATE=
